I am the Director of Android Engineering at Big Nerd Ranch where I am responsible for a team of engineers, leading consulting projects, teaching Android development courses, and authoring our Android Programming book. My focus lately has been on the growth and happiness of the people that I work with. 

When not working, I spend as much time as possible on my motorcycle, running, and traveling.
