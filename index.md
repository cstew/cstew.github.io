I am the VP of Engineering at Big Nerd Ranch where I am responsible for our engineering team offering Android, iOS, and Web development + training. My goal is to build a world-class engineering team that delights our customers.

When not working, I spend as much time as possible on my motorcycle, running, and traveling.
